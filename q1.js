/* Title: HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2

// Introduction to HTTP:
                HTTP, the protocol that powers the World Wide Web, enables the transfer of various data types 
between clients (such as web browsers) and servers. Since its inception, HTTP has undergone several iterations,
each aimed at enhancing performance, security, and functionality. HTTP/1.1, the predecessor to HTTP/2,
has long been the standard protocol for web communication but began to show limitations as web technologies 
advanced and user demands grew.

// Key Differences:

1. Multiplexing:  
   - HTTP/1.1 employs a serial request-response mechanism, where each request must be processed sequentially,
    leading to potential delays, especially for complex web pages.
   - HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent and
    received concurrently over a single connection. This enables more efficient resource utilization
     and significantly reduces latency, leading to faster page load times.

2. Header Compression: 
   - In HTTP/1.1, headers are sent in plain text with each request and response, 
   resulting in unnecessary overhead, especially for small payloads.
   - HTTP/2 utilizes header compression techniques, such as HPACK, to reduce the 
   size of headers before transmission. This minimizes bandwidth usage and speeds up data transfer, 
   particularly beneficial for mobile devices and low-bandwidth connections.

3. Server Push:
   - A notable feature of HTTP/2 is server push, allowing servers to proactively push 
   resources to clients before they are requested. This eliminates the need for additional
    round trips and can significantly improve perceived load times.
   - HTTP/1.1 lacks native support for server push, requiring clients to request each 
   resource individually, leading to potential inefficiencies and slower page rendering.

4. Binary Protocol: 
   - HTTP/1.1 relies on textual representation for communication between clients and servers,
    which can be verbose and inefficient, especially for large payloads.
   - HTTP/2 introduces a binary protocol, which is more compact and efficient for parsing, 
   resulting in reduced overhead and faster processing by both clients and servers.

 //Conclusion:

In conclusion, the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents a significant leap forward in the evolution
of web protocols. By addressing the limitations of its predecessor and introducing innovative features such as
multiplexing, header compression, server push, and a binary protocol, HTTP/2 has revolutionized the way data is exchanged on the web.
These advancements not only enhance performance but also pave the way for richer, more interactive web experiences. 
As web technologies continue to evolve, HTTP/2 stands as a testament to the ongoing quest for faster, more efficient, and 
more resilient communication protocols in the digital age. */
